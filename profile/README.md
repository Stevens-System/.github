# Stevens-System

This organization (a repo of repos) is an eco-system for two most badass courses at Stevens Institute of Technology:
- **(CS-382)** Computer Architecture & Organization;
- **(CS-392)** Systems Programming.

It's possible that other courses will be added here as well (_e.g.,_ CS-492 Operating Systems), but no courses can compete with my boys 382+392!

Let's goooooo!
